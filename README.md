#### Profile

I am a computational scientist. I started my academic journey by modelling ion channel activity for calcium channels.
From there, I moved onto developing dowmstream analysis for calcium signals imaged via fluorescence microscopy. 
In 2018, I started my transition from academia to industry and was selected to be an Insight Data Science Fellow. 
At Insight, I upskilled, learnt industry tools, worked on Timemapper.app and came across the wide variety of roles that fall under the 'data science' label. 
Post Insight, I have worked as a data scientist in Industry particularly specializing in computer vision in the Biotech sector.

This is my personal repository and does not reflect any work done for companies I was employed with.
